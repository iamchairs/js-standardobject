A Prototype JS Object with Simple Event-Driven Functionality

The StandardObject is lightweight, simple, and should be apart of anyones application. It contains the bare-bones functionality for an asynchronous event driven application and doesn't intrude or enforce any style of programming. Even though I created the StandardObject for my own purposes I have not added application-specific functionality to use. The power is in the simplicity and abstraction the class provides. Larger applications become a breeze when events are properly used and reviewing old code is much simple without all the spagetti.

See the examples and try using StandardObject with your next web app!
